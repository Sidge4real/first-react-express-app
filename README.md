React: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces on the client-side. It focuses on creating reusable UI components and efficiently updating the user interface through a virtual DOM. React manages the application state and allows developers to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Express: Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime. It enables developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Express handles incoming client requests, routes them to appropriate handlers, and sends back responses. It simplifies server-side development and facilitates the creation of APIs, handling data processing and business logic.
